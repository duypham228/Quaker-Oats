Earthquakes are a disaster of interest in current times especially with the increase in their frequency and damage caused. Given the dispersion of various resources of earthquakes over the internet, we propose and develop an end-to-end integrated system that can help users analyze the impact of earthquakes in an interactive manner. Our system also aims at providing scientific information about earthquakes and related disasters as well as information about specific earthquakes through related articles. This paper explores the various stages of the development of our integrated interactive worldwide earthquake analysis system.
