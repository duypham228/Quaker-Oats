1	2	 Iran is one of the most seismically active countries in the world, being crossed by several major faults that cover at least 90% of the country . The Iranian Plate is bordered by the Indian Plate, the Eurasian Plate, and the Arabian Plate (to the south and west) Since 1900, at least 126,000 fatalities have resulted from earthquakes in Iran . The country is well known for its long history of disastrous earthquake activity . It is also known for the waste of valuable natural resources and the deaths of at least 125,000 people since 1900 . Iran has a history of earthquakes that have killed thousands of people and waste valuable resources in the country's natural resources, such as the Zag

The shaking lasted for about two minutes and caused widespread damage, especially to brick or stone structures . Most of the buildings damaged in the earthquake were rebuilt in wood[2] and this contributed to the relatively low level of damage and loss of life in the more powerful Wairarapa earthquake that hit Wellington seven years later . The earthquake killed 3 people and left millions of dollars in damage . It was the first earthquake to hit New Zealand's South Island in 1848 and was centered in the Marlboro region of New Zealand .

The most recent major earthquake was the 921 earthquake, which struck on 21 September 1999, and claimed 2,4 lives . The first recorded earthquake in Taiwan was in 1624, the founding year of Dutch Formosa . Between 1901 and 2000 there were 91 major earthquakes in Taiwan, 48 of them resulting in loss of life . Most of the earthquakes registered in Taiwan actually occur off the east coast and cause little damage, whereas smaller quakes beneath the island itself have historically proven more destructive .

Each of the submarine earthquakes in the sequence triggered tsunami . The June event was moderate relative to the large September 11 event, which had at least one aftershock that also generated a tsunami . Natural gas that was released from the sea floor created flames that were visible along the co-section of the surface of the seabed floor . The 1927 Crimean earthquake killed 12 people and triggered a tsunami in the area of Yalta, Crimea, in the wake of the June event, and the September 11 aftershocks were foreshocks of 6.0 and 4.9

USGS: Indonesia has had more than 150 earthquakes with magnitude > 7 in the period 1901–2017 . Six of the Top Ten strongest Indonesian earthquakes ≥ 8.3 Mw occurred near Sumatra and along the Java Trench, with six of the strongest earthquakes in the country's history occurring near the Sumatra Trench .

1522	1522	 An earthquake occurred off the northern coast of the Kamchatka Peninsula in the USSR, present-day Russia . The earthquake had a surface wave magnitude (Ms ) of 6.8 to 7.3 and an estimated moment magnitude (Mw) of 8.2 Mw[4] This event came just two months after a slightly larger Mw  8.4 earthquake, with the epicenter south of the April event, struck the area . Both earthquakes were tsunamigenic althth, and the death toll from the 1923 event was 36, with most of the victims being killed by a 30-metre-magnitude tsunami of up to 30 meters .

He has stressed the importance of science and technology and the extent to which the effects of a potential disaster can be curbed . He also expressed a disagreement and disapproval with the notion in Iran that natural disasters are God given and that natural disaster is God's given . He said: ""Earthquake education is very poor in Iran. Most people think that whatever God wills, will happen. This is absolutely wrong. This thinking is poisonous. Most of the people in Iran think whatever God wants to happen will happen"" He has been a strong advocate"

Both earthquakes triggered tsunamis that were observed around the northern part of the Pacific Ocean . The Kuril islands form part of an island arc formed above the subduction zone, where the Pacific Plate is being subducted beneath the Eurasian Plate . This convergent boundary has been the site of many large megathrust earthquakes, including the 1963 Kuril Islands earthquake and the Soviet Union . The Soviet Union was the only country affected by the earthquake .
